            <div id="description">
               <p>Here is a lot of odd things that I can vaguely remember.  Althouhg not about a strict "about me" section, it should give you a hint of who I am</p>
               
                   <p>I learned how to drive when my boss asked me to drive his car to his house, the following week I got my driver's license.
                       Also, during college, bought a $500 Ford Fiesta with 120K miles, drove to Costa Rica and sold it for $5,000</p>

                   <p>A lot of crazy stuff.  Think graduated and got a good job, so good life starts, right?  Nope, back to Ramen noodles
                       as I decided to pay off students loans within a year of graduation</p>

                    <p>I have played soccer all of my life, and as my kids started growing up, I decided they would be the next better
                        players in the family.  Armed with all of my "talent", my kids decided to play baseball or softball.... tough on 
                        me, now I had to learn how to play the sport.
                    </p>

                    <p>BTW, I paid for college by working as a programmer.  When people asked me what languaged I learned, I say simply
                        RPG.  Yes, everyone asks the same:  What is it?
                    </p>
                    <p> Finally, the last think I would say is that I would have never in my life guessed I would have gone and lived in Moseley.  
                        we moved there so my older son could go to Cosby High School.  Well, when it was time, he decided to go to Midlothian High, go figure
                    </p>

                    <p>Well I guess I still need to write something so that I would know for sure if the text is wrapping around my picture.
                        I could possibly just reduce the size of the picture, but I will let it be like that for now
                    </p>
