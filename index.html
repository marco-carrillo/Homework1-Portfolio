               <p>Here is a lot of odd things that I can vaguely remember.  Althouhg not about a strict "about me" section, it should give you a hint of who I am</p>
               
                   <p>I learned how to drive when my boss asked me to drive his car to his house, I am sure he learned his lesson since I likely
                       blew up the stick shift transmission. But I learned to drive that day, next week, got my driver's license. </p>

                       Talking about cars, craziest thing I did during college, bought a $500 Ford Fiesta with 120K miles, drove to Costa Rica and sold it for $5,000</p>

                   <p>A lot of crazy stuff.  Think graduated and got a good job, so good life starts, right?  Nope, back to Ramen noodles
                       as I decided to pay off students loans within a year of graduation</p>

                    <p>BTW, I paid for college by working as a programmer.  When people asked me what languaged I learned, I say simply
                        RPG.  Yes, everyone asks the same:  What is it?  Whenever I find out, I will let you know......
                    </p>
                    <p>That concludes the "About me" section</p>
               
            </div>
