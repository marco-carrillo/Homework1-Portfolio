       <p>Here is a lot of odd things that I can vaguely remember.  Althouhg not about a strict "about me" section, it should give you a hint of who I am</p>
       <ul>
           <li>I learned how to drive when my boss asked me to drive his car to his house, the following week I got my driver's license</li>
           <li>During college, bought a $500 Ford Fiesta with 120K miles, drove to Costa Rica and sold it for $5,000</li>
           <li>Paid off students loans within a year of graduation</li>
           <li>Played soccer and was good at it.  Kids decided they liked baseball/softball, so I had to learn to be able to coach them</li>
           <li>Performed all maintenance to my first car, from oil change, brake changes, suspension, etc.</li>
           <li>Was a realtor so that I could learn from other's mistakes and start Real Estate investments</li>
           <li>I worked as a programer to pay for college.  Programming language was RPG..... yes, everyone asks what the heck is that....</li>
           <li>My first job at age 12, was picking up coffee.... Within a day, I knew I wasn't destined for physical work as my friends were</li>
           <li>iPhone die-hard until my son convinced me to switch to Android.  Never looked back!!!!</li>
           <li>My first experience working with spreadsheets was using Quattro.... Again, you don't see that anymore</li>
           <li>My first computer didn't have hard disk.  We booted from 5.25" floppy disks that had half a megabyte of storage</li>
           <li>That storage included the operating system (DOS)</li>
       </ul>
