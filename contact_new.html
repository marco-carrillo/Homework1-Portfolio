               <p>Here is a lot of odd things that I can vaguely remember.  Althouhg not about a strict "about me" section, it should give you a hint of who I am</p>
               
                   <p>I learned how to drive when my boss asked me to drive his car to his house, the following week I got my driver's license.
                       Also, during college, bought a $500 Ford Fiesta with 120K miles, drove to Costa Rica and sold it for $5,000</p>

                   <p>A lot of crazy stuff.  Think graduated and got a good job, so good life starts, right?  Nope, back to Ramen noodles
                       as I decided to pay off students loans within a year of graduation</p>

                    <p>I have played soccer all of my life, and as my kids started growing up, I decided they would be the next better
                        players in the family.  Armed with all of my "talent", my kids decided to play baseball or softball.... tough on 
                        me, now I had to learn how to play the sport.
                    </p>

                    <p>BTW, I paid for college by working as a programmer.  When people asked me what languaged I learned, I say simply
                        RPG.  Yes, everyone asks the same:  What is it?
                    </p>
